                    <h2>Puzzle Games</h2>
                    <p>I have a deep passion for puzzle games, enjoying the intellectual challenge they provide. From solving the Rubik's Cube to navigating escape rooms, and tackling Sudoku, I thrive on the mental stimulation they offer. One of my favorite challenges is the sliding puzzle, where you rearrange scrambled pieces in a box with one empty spot to form the correct order. These games are not just a pastime for me; they are a way to sharpen my problem-solving skills and keep my mind agile.</p>
